## Project Overview
AdventureWorks Database is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) database. The AdventureWorks Database supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles. Analyzed data of this fictitious company by connecting and shaping data in Power Query, built a relational model and added 
calculate fields with DAX measures. Finally, created an interactive Dashboard for data visualization of the performance of the company.

## Power BI Features & Concepts Used:
Power Query Editor for transforming raw data, handling null values, and creating conditional columns.<br>
Data Modeling using relationships between tables (fact and dimension) to ensure seamless interaction between the datasets.<br>
DAX measures for calculating dynamic metrics like revenue growth, sales trends, and profit margins.<br>
Interactive Visuals such as funnel charts, bar charts with secondary stepped lines, and map visualizations with filters, making it easy to explore the data in-depth
